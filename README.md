A Copy of the Codebase for all of my projects can be found in the "Codebase For Projects" folder.

6) Fix bug that takes you to the wrong page after clicking title on home page


<h2> Finance Web App </h2>
Located within my "Stock Look Up" folder. This Web App allows a user to register with a password, login to my website, enter a stock ticker which then can be looked up within the IEX cloud API. Password's are stored using hash functions to increase security. The API pulls the full name and stock price by the user entering the ticker. Click the link below to test it out:
