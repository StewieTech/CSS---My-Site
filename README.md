Web App built with Python, Flask, MySQL 

** Future Updates **
1) Update Sell function and add ability to look at Portfolio
2) Deploy on Heroku


<h2> Newsletter Signup </h2>

Currrently located in my Heroku web app . Using similar logic, I will deploy my other apps on Heroku. The Newsletter is built by connecting to a mailchimp API. Currently it is using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & javascript. To visit

<h2> Todo List </h2>
Currently located in my "/MongoDB/ToDo List v2" folder, my created todo list was my first Heroku Web app that's connected to a NoSQL MongoDB Atlas backend. Really excited as now my data persists and I can save and store items in my todo list :D. Give it a try below:
